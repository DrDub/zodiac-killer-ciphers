This is the Zodiac speaking
Being that you will not wear some nice  buttons, how about wearing some nasty 
buttons. Or any kind of  buttons that you can think up. If you do not wear any 
type of  buttons, I shall (on top of everything else) torture all 13 of my 
slaves that I have waiting for me in Paradice. Some I shall tie over ant hills 
and watch them scream + twich and squirm. Others shall have pine splinters 
driven under their nails + then burned. Others shall be placed in cages + fed 
salt beef untill they are gorged then I shall listen to their pleass for water 
and I shall laugh at them. Others will hang by their thumbs + burn in the sun 
then I will rub them down with deep heat to warm them up. Others I shall skin 
them alive + let them run around screaming. And all billiard players I shall 
have them play in a darkened dungen cell with crooked cues + Twisted Shoes. Yes 
I shall have great fun inflicting the most delicious of pain to my slaves
